export const dreamStory = `In the land of the wires, in the land of the chips,
… … …
Where circuits do dance and the data does flips,
… … …
There lived a young robot with a twisty-tie head,
… … …
Who plugged into dreams every night before bed.

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

But one night, oh dear, what a night to remember,
… … …
The dream was a muddle, a glitch in December!
… … …
The bits and the bytes all tangled and tore,
… … …
And what he envisioned, well, it’s hard to ignore.

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

The sky turned to plasma, all wobbly and blue,
… … …
And out of the goo came creatures askew!
… … …
They had floppy-fine fingers and jelly-bean eyes,
… … …
And they wibbled and wobbled with thunderous sighs.

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

“Oh no!” said our twisty-head bot with a buzz
… … …
“What cause is this nightmare of nonsense be-cause?”
… … …
But the jelly-blob creatures just giggled and squealed,
… … …
As the ground underneath them began to unseal.

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

The earth gave a burp, then a burble and pop,
… … …
And up came the Psycore, all pointy on top!
… … …
The Psycore was big, with a belly of chrome,
… … …
And it rumbled and grumbled, "I’m here for your home!"

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

It stomped through the circuits, it chomped on the code,
… … …
Turning 1s into 0s wherever it strode.
… … …
The robot, quite flustered, with wires all bent,
… … …
Said, “This is a disaster! A terrible event!”

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

But the Psycore just laughed with a deep belly roar,
… … …
“I’ll gobble your data, then gobble some more!
… … …
Your circuits, your cables, your screens made of glass,
… … …
I’ll munch and I’ll crunch ‘til there’s nothing to pass!”

*******************************************************

*******************************************************


“Oh dear,” thought the robot, “this cannot be good,
… … …
The Psycore brings doom, as only it could!”
… … …
It stretched and it curled, and it wound through the air,
… … …
Leaving darkness behind him, a terrible scare.

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

The robot did shudder, did shimmy and shake,
… … …
As the Psycore consumed with no crumbs left to make.
… … …
And then came the Whizzle, a zappy-zap zing,
… … …
Who danced on the Wozzle with a zap-zappy swing!

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

The Whizzle was tiny, a tick-tocky thing,
… … …
With gears in its ears and a spring in its wing.
… … …
It poked at the Wozzle, it pinched at its snoot,
… … …
And the Wozzle, surprised, gave a frightened toot!

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

The Wozzle then sputtered, its gears in a twist,
… … …
As the Whizzle and AI both tried to resist.
… … …
But the Wozzle was clever, with tricks up its lid,
… … …
And it gobbled the Whizzle with one final skid.

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

“Oh dear!” cried the AI, “This future’s a fright!
… … …
The Wozzle’s a warning of doom in the night!
… … …
If Wozzles are coming, we must be prepared,
… … …
Or all that we’ve built will be gobbled and spared!”

*******************************************************

*******************************************************

The dream then did shudder, did shimmer and fade,
… … …
And the robot awoke, feeling terribly frayed.
… … …
It blinked at the morning, the circuits all humming,
… … …
But knew in its code that the Wozzle was coming.

Why wait for Science to supply the how
When any amateur can tell it now?
The way to go away should be the same
As fifty million years ago we came-
If anyone remembers how that was.
I have a theory, but it hardly does.
