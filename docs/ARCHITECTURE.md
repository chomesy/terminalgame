Game Architecture Overview
Your text adventure game is designed using a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components or classes. Each component has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand, extend, and maintain. The key components are:

Game State Management (GameStateManager)
Story Content (storyContent)
Input Handling (InputHandler)
Command Parsing (CommandParser)
Action Dispatching (ActionDispatcher)
Output Rendering (OutputRenderer)
Event System (EventSystem)
Game Loop (GameLoop)
1. Game State Management (GameStateManager)
Purpose:
To manage and maintain the current state of the game, such as the player's location, inventory, and other dynamic elements.

Key Elements:

State: Holds properties like location and inventory.
Methods:
getState(): Returns the current state.
updateState(updates: Partial<GameState>): Updates the state with new values.
Usage:
This class is used to keep track of the game's evolving state, ensuring that changes (e.g., moving from one location to another) are reflected throughout the game.

2. Story Content (storyContent)
Purpose:
To hold static content related to the game's narrative, such as descriptions of locations and items.

Key Elements:

Locations: An object that maps location names to their corresponding descriptions.
Usage:
This content is referenced whenever the game needs to provide the player with narrative descriptions, such as when they look around a room or move to a new location.

3. Input Handling (InputHandler)
Purpose:
To handle and manage user input, capturing commands typed into the terminal.

Key Elements:

Methods:
handleInputChange(e, setInput): Updates the input state as the user types.
handleInputSubmit(e, input, processCommand): Processes the command when the user submits it.
Usage:
The InputHandler is responsible for managing the user's input, ensuring that it is correctly captured and passed on for further processing.

4. Command Parsing (CommandParser)
Purpose:
To interpret and parse user commands, translating raw input into standardized commands that the game can execute.

Key Elements:

Methods:
parse(command: string): Converts the user’s command into a lowercase, standardized format.
Usage:
This class ensures that user commands are in a consistent format before they are passed on to the ActionDispatcher.

5. Action Dispatching (ActionDispatcher)
Purpose:
To execute the parsed commands and interact with the game state and story content, driving the game forward.

Key Elements:

Methods:
executeCommand(command: string): Executes the command based on the current game state.
getLocationDescription(location: string): Retrieves the description of the current location.
Usage:
The ActionDispatcher is the core logic handler that determines the outcome of user commands, such as moving to a new location or interacting with objects.

6. Output Rendering (OutputRenderer)
Purpose:
To manage the output displayed in the terminal, ensuring that the game’s responses to user commands are properly formatted and presented.

Key Elements:

Methods:
render(lines: string[], newLine: string): Adds a new line of text to the terminal output.
Usage:
This class updates the display, making sure the player sees the results of their actions, such as the description of a new location or a response to a command.

7. Event System (EventSystem)
Purpose:
To handle dynamic events and triggers in the game, responding to changes in the game state.

Key Elements:

Methods:
checkTriggers(): Evaluates conditions based on the current game state to trigger events.
Usage:
The EventSystem monitors the game state and can trigger events or changes in response to certain conditions, such as unlocking a new area when a player collects a specific item.

8. Game Loop (GameLoop)
Purpose:
To tie all the components together and manage the main flow of the game, from handling input to rendering output.

Key Elements:

Attributes:
Contains instances of GameStateManager, InputHandler, CommandParser, ActionDispatcher, OutputRenderer, and EventSystem.
Methods:
start(input: string): Processes the entire game loop for a given user input, including parsing, executing actions, and rendering output.
Usage:
The GameLoop coordinates all the other components, ensuring that user input is processed, actions are executed, and the game state is updated and displayed.

Integration: Terminal Emulator (TerminalEmulator.tsx)
The TerminalEmulator React component serves as the user interface, where the player interacts with the game. It captures input, passes it through the GameLoop, and updates the display with the results.

Flow of Control:
User Input: The player types a command.
Input Handling: InputHandler captures the command and passes it to the GameLoop.
Command Parsing: CommandParser standardizes the command.
Action Execution: ActionDispatcher executes the command, possibly updating the game state.
Event Triggering: EventSystem checks for any events that should be triggered based on the new state.
Output Rendering: OutputRenderer formats the output, and the TerminalEmulator displays it to the player.
